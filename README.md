# The Finite Difference Method applied to the Acoustic Wave Equation
Files for the report on the numerical analysis of acoustic waves by means of the finite difference equation. 

Wavesimulator.ipynb is the main file which can be ran from a jupyter notebook. It imports the other two files (functions and pressure)
